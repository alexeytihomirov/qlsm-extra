"""qlmatch-packer's private copy of the server.cfg cvar text helpers.

Used to be ui/stats_hub.py's cvar helpers in qlsm core (pure text
operations, no feature-specific state, so they were "ungrouped" there
despite the module's name) -- shared with telemetry-relay and demo-stream
too. Duplicated instead of kept shared for the same reason as
.instance_demo_transport (see that module's docstring): no addon-to-addon
dependency mechanism to rely on.
